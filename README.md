+SPM
====

object-oriented interface to scanning probe microscopy images for Matlab

Installation
------------

Just download and unpack in a folder named +SPM wherever on your Matlab path.

If you have git installed under *nix just type the following from the command-line.

	git clone git://github.com/antoinerg/SPM.git +SPM
	
Configuration
-------------

Before using it, you will need to create a configuration file called "config.m" in the root of the directory. A sample configuration file is provided called "config.m.sample"

Usage
-----

Will follow soon. Ideally we will document all the features in Matlab.

Testing
-------

No automated testing of the code is in place.

Contributing
------------

For now, pretty much contact me over email with your patch and I will incorporate it.
