A sample configuration file is provided called \"config.m.sample\"\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWill follow soon. Ideally we will document all the features in Matlab.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nNo automated testing of the code is in place.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nFor now, pretty much contact me over email with your patch and I will incorporate it.\r\n\r\nCollaborators\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nIn no particular order, I would like to thanks the following individuals for their contributions to this project:\r\n\r\n* William Paul\r\n* Mehdi El Ouali\r\n* Zeno Schumacher\r\n* Aaron Mascaro\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
